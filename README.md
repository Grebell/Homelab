# Homelab

Welcome to my home lab Documentation and stuff!

It's currently running on an old HP OMEN laptop because my box server is messed up. (I think it's a network card issue.)

```
Proxmox                  
├── NAS CT
├── TailScale CT
└── Debian Server
   X├── MC Server (maybe)
    ├── Portainer
    │   ├── Homepage
    │  X└── Pihole (not running, incompatible with the current router)
   X└── Plex (in progress)
       X└── all the ARRs and tools to get it up and running
```
